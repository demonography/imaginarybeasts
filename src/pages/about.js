        <h1>Hi, I'm Ris.</h1>
        <p>I am a non-binary gendered visual communicator who likes to draw, design, code, and eat. Most of the time you will find me doing a combination of the above.</p>
        <p>I graduated from the Alberta College of Art and Design in 2012 with a degree in Visual Communications and an appreciation for caffeinated beverages.</p>
        <p>I currently work as an interactive designer and a front-end developer, with a good dose of illustration on the side.</p>
        <p>I am also currently growing my skills as a mentor and educator by teaching and volunteering.</p>
