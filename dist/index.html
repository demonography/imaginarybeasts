            Iris, or Ris, is a non-binary visual communicator who likes to draw,
            design, animate, code, and eat. Most of the time you will find them
            doing a combination of the above.
          </p>
          <p>
            Iris has volunteered with organizations aimed at increasing
            diversity in the design and tech field, and has read several
            magazines and possibly a book. Their personal work focuses on the
            liminal space between things that are cute and things that are cool.
